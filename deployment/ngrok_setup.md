# ðŸš€ Project Deployment Instructions & Log

This file contains instructions for deploying the Streamlit application.

---
## Method 1: Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended for Production)
This is the primary method for a permanent, public, and free deployment.

**Final Application URL:**
**[https://heart-disease-app-example.streamlit.app](https://heart-disease-prediction-app-1.streamlit.app/)** 

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Ensure all final code changes are pushed to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.
2. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard: [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Click **"New app"**.
4. Select the correct GitHub repository and the `main` branch.
5. Set the "Main file path" to: `ui/app.py`
6. Click **"Deploy!"**. The app will update automatically with every new push to the main branch.

## Method 2: Ngrok (For Temporary Local Testing)
Use this method to quickly share a locally running version of the app for a short time.

**Setup Steps:**
1. In your first terminal, run the Streamlit app locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/app.py
   ```

2. In a second terminal, expose the local port (default is 8501) using Ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8501
   ```

3. Copy the public URL provided by Ngrok. **Note:** This URL is temporary and will expire when you close the Ngrok process.
